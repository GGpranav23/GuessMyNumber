The technical term for making JavaScript interact with webpages is called DOM Manipulation

NOTE: What is DOM?
DOM is document object model. It is a structured representation of the HTML documents 

NOTE: DOM allows the JavaScript to access the HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.

NOTE: HTML Documents -----DOM------ JavaScript Code


The DOM is created as soon as the HTML page loads in the browser and is stored in a tree structure.

1. When a web browser loads an HTML document, it creates the DOM
2. The browser automatically converts the HTML document into a DOM tree
3. Each HTML element becomes a node in this tree structure
4. This happens before any JavaScript code runs
5. Once created, JavaScript can then access and manipulate the DOM through various methods and properties

NOTE: DOM and DOM methods are a part of Web APIs and not a part of JavaScript language.

NOTE: APIs stand for Application Programming Interface
